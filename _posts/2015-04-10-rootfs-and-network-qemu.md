---
In host Linux shell, run below command to start gdb first.

    (gdb) set architecture arm
    The target architecture is assumed to be arm
    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    Remote debugging using localhost:1234


Start Qemu. Please note that "-s" is used for debugging.

    qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -kernel zImage -append "console=tty1 root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=10.0.2.2:/busybox/_install rw ip=dhcp init=/sbin/init" -s

Then you can debug your kernel.
