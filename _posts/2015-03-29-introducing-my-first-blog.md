##My First Blog
Hey! I'm [Zhiyi](https://google.com/+ZhiyiSun). This is my first blog powered by github.io. I use [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) based [lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) to build this site. It is supper easy to create it. I got a big hint from [Joshua Lande's blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). 

I'm using [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/editor) to create this Markdown file.

Hope I can keep updating this blog. :-)
