	Hey there! This is Zhiyi's Homepage. 
</p>

## Who am I, and what do I do?

I'm [Zhiyi Sun](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhiyisun). I live in Shanghai, China. I work at [Applied Micro Circuits](http://apm.com), previously at [Altera](http://www.altera.com), [LSI](http://www.lsi.com), [Turin Networks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/turin-networks), [ZTE](http://www.zte.com) as an software engineer. I am focusing on [ARMv8](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/armv8-architecture.php), [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/), networking, [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), etc.

## What hardware do I use?

I'm typing this on a [MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch,Early 2015)](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp715?locale=en_US). This is my only laptop for both work and personal stuff. It is enough for me to running [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/server) inside of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)/[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

For a phone, I use [XiaoMi Mi4c](http://www.mi.com/mi4c/) as my primary smartphone. The size is quite fit my pocket.

I also has a [Kindle 4](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eReader-eBook-Reader-e-Reader-Special-Offers/dp/B0051QVESA). I bought it in 2011. I used it quite often when I took subway train to office or in the airport/train station.

I bought a [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) this spring. I use it as an personal server on my desk.

## And what software?

* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), I used Firefox for many years. But its Android version has problem with Wechat. So I switch to Chrome.
* [OSX EL Capitan](https://www.apple.com/osx/) But I think I can use any OS. I use OSX only because it is best fit for MacBook. I'm comfortable with Ubuntu too. I used it for several years at home.
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), an amazing tool for virtualization on my Macbook.
* [Virtual Box](http://virtualbox.org), of course.
* [Vim](http://vim.org) with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), I have a bunch of vim plugins. It is a very handy tool for coding without mouse.
* [Evernote](http://evernote.com), good note app. But become biger and biger. Now it limits two devices for free user. I'm considering to switch to another note app.
* [Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/), also from Evernote.
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), read it later.
* [有道词典](http://dict.youdao.com/), Chinese <-> English
* [百度云](http://pan.baidu.com), all my files are backup to this cloud.
* etc

Thanks for reading!
