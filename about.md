	Hey there! This is Zhiyi's Homepage. 
</p>

I'm [Zhiyi Sun](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhiyisun). I'm an engineer, previously at [LSI](http://www.lsi.com), [Turin Networks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/turin-networks), [ZTE](http://www.zte.com), currently at [Altera](http://www.altera.com). At [Turin Networks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/turin-networks) and [ZTE](http://www.zte.com), I was an embedded software engineer. At [LSI](http://www.lsi.com), I was System Application Engineer. At [Altera](http://www.altera.com), I am working on the software of [Altera's](http://www.altera.com) Dev Kits.

## What hardware do you use?

I'm typing this on a [MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP649?locale=en_US). I use it at home. I upgraded it to 8GB memory. So it is enough for me to running Ubuntu inside of VirtualBox.

My work laptop is a [Thinkpad T540p](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t540p). It has 16GB memory. But due to the IT security software installed on it, it is slower than my own MacBook. I don't like its touchpad at all. It is far away behind MacBook. I also have a DELL 29" display at my desk. I use it as my primary monitor.

For a phone, I use [OnePlus one](http://oneplus.net/one) with [CM11S](http://cyanogenmod.org) installed as my primary smartphone.

I also has a [Kindle 4](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eReader-eBook-Reader-e-Reader-Special-Offers/dp/B0051QVESA). I bought it in 2011. I used it quite often when I took subway train to office.

## And what software?

* Browser[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) I used Firefox for many years. But its Android version has problem with Wechat. So I switch to Chrome.
* [OSX Yosemite](https://www.apple.com/osx/) But I think I can use any OS. I use OSX only because it is best fit for MacBook. I'm also compatible with Ubuntu. I used it for several years at home.
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), an amazing tool for virtual OS.
* [Virtual Box](http://virtualbox.org) of course.
* [Vim](http://vim.org)
* [Evernote](http://evernote.com)
* etc

Thanks for reading!
